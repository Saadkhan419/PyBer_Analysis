# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis.
 - The analysis was done to create graph data using the Matplotlib library and to use mathematical calculations on the DataFrames. We also added the titles, axes, labels, legends and custom colours to create a more informative data.
 
 # Results:
 1) Urban Cities have the significatnly more rides as compared to rural and suburban cities. The least rides were in rural cities.
 2) As urban cities have more rides it makes sense to have more drivers and fares in the urban cities. It is shown that the urban cities have almost 4x more drivers than suburban cities.
 3) Average price per city and per drivers is highest in rural cities.
 
 # Summary:
  Based on the results, the three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types are as below:
   - By increasing the number of drivers in the Rural areas we can ensure to meet the ride demand which in turn can decrease the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. This can help to reduce the loss in potential revenue when there are peaks in business.
   - A similar strategy can be used for suburban areas.
   - For urban areas, I would suggest to maintain the current situtation as this is the most important part of the business.
